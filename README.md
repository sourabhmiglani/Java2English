Use Case:-
a. For New Joinees to reduce their dependency on kt videos and other developers.
b. For Buisness Analysts/Non tech guys to reduce their dependency on Developer.

Features to be added:-

1. Java class chunking logic -> Separating class into methods(As there is a limit on the words we can send to gpt) so we need to send the file as some chunks and then stitch the reponses of llm)
2. Storing the English Summary back to a repository/azure blob as the same folder structure.
